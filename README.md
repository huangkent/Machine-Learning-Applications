# Machine-Learning-Applications

This repository provides code of these application:
1) Tic Tac Toe play and learn
   method: the Least Mean Square method
   coding: MatLab
2) Handwritten Digits Recognition on small images
   method: random forest
   coding: Python
   data:   train and test sets provided
3) curve_fitting.cpp is used to generate a curve to fit (x, y) data, by accurately estimating the coefficients of a best-fitting curve
   method: gradient descent
   coding: C++
   input manner: by a text file (e.g. .dat), in which there are two columns of numbers (one column is x data, and the other is y data)
   recommended platform: Linux
   run the code:  $ g++ curve_fitting.cpp  (will generate a.out)
                  $ ./a.out < input.dat
